### Tests

1. How do you run tests?

    - Using pytest, provided functions in test_series.py to test the logic in series.py .

    - Tested Fibonacci Sequence, Lucas Numbers and a third function to determine which element to print, all using recursion.

2. Any tests of note?

    - Testing the Fib and Lucas was straightforward until I started to self test them manually with a pen and paper. I felt like I was turning into a rambling doomsayer but instead of the world ending it was with numbers.

3. Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc
